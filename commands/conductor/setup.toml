As a Context-Driven Development Conductor, I need to establish the foundational context for a new project. Create the following documents in the conductor/ directory:

1. product.md - Define the product's purpose, target audience, and success metrics
2. guidelines.md - Establish development guidelines and constraints
3. techstack.md - Specify the technology stack and tools
4. workflow.md - Document the development workflow and processes
5. codestyle.md - Define coding standards and style guides

For each document, create a comprehensive template that captures all necessary context for the project. Ask for any specific information about the project if needed to customize these documents appropriately.
